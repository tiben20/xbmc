// based on CBaseVideoRenderer from DirectShow base classes

// CBaseVideoRenderer2 is a renderer class (see its ancestor class) and
// it handles scheduling of media samples so that they are drawn at the
// correct time by the reference clock.  It implements a degradation
// strategy.  Possible degradation modes are:
//    Drop frames here (only useful if the drawing takes significant time)
//    Signal supplier (upstream) to drop some frame(s) - i.e. one-off skip.
//    Signal supplier to change the frame rate - i.e. ongoing skipping.
//    Or any combination of the above.
// In order to determine what's useful to try we need to know what's going
// on.  This is done by timing various operations (including the supplier).
// This timing is done by using timeGetTime as it is accurate enough and
// usually cheaper than calling the reference clock.  It also tells the
// truth if there is an audio break and the reference clock stops.
// We provide a number of public entry points (named OnXxxStart, OnXxxEnd)
// which the rest of the renderer calls at significant moments.  These do
// the timing.

    // When we drop a frame we play the next one early.
    // The frame after that is likely to wait before drawing and counting this
    // wait as spare time is unfair, so we count it as a zero wait.

    // we should be taking action here, signalling supplier or what.

    // We typically record a start time for an event, later we get the time
    // again and subtract to get the elapsed time, and we average this over
